            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p class="lead">
              As the agricultural sector seeks sustainable and cost-effective
              energy solutions, wind turbines are becoming a popular choice for
              farmers worldwide. By harnessing wind energy, farms can reduce
              electricity costs, lower their carbon footprint, and achieve
              energy independence. With advancements in technology, wind
              turbines are now more accessible, efficient, and adaptable to
              rural landscapes. This article explores the benefits, challenges,
              and implementation of wind turbines for farms.

            <h3>Why Wind Energy Matters for Farms?</h3>
            <p class="lead">
              Wind energy is one of the cleanest and most sustainable energy
              sources. Farms are uniquely positioned to take advantage of wind
              power due to their large open spaces, minimal obstructions, and
              higher-than-average wind speeds. By installing wind turbines,
              farmers can:
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              <strong>1. Reduce Energy Costs: </strong>Generate electricity to
              power farm operations, irrigation systems, and buildings.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Increase Energy Independence:</strong> Depend less on the
              grid and fossil fuels.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              <strong> Promote Sustainability:</strong> Contribute to cleaner
              air and lower greenhouse gas emissions.
            </p>

            <p class="lead">
              <strong>Diversify Income:</strong>Lease land to wind energy
              companies or sell excess energy back to the grid.
            </p>

            <h3>Types of Wind Turbines for Farms</h3>
